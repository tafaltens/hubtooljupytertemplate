# githubexample

.keep files are present to force git to track initially empty directories.
Should the directories become populated the .keep file can be removed.

This is the GitHUB repo for the example nanoHUB app, "githubexample".
The corresponding nanoFORGE wiki is: https://nanohub.org/tools/githubexample/wiki
